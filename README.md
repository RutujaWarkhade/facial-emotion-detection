# Facial Emotion Detection Web App ðŸ˜ƒ  

This project is a **Flask-based web application** that detects human emotions from uploaded facial images using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the [Face Expression Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset/data).  

The application allows users to **upload an image**, and it predicts the emotion with a **confidence score**, while displaying the processed image on the webpage.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Upload a facial image through the web interface  
- Deep learning model predicts the emotion:  
  - Happy  
  - Sad  
  - Angry  
  - Surprise  
  - Neutral  
  - Fear  
  - Disgust  
- Displays confidence score (%)  
- Responsive and clean **Bootstrap UI**  
- Built with **Flask (backend)** and **HTML/CSS (frontend)**

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
We trained the model using the [Face Expression Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset/data).  

- Contains **48x48 grayscale images** of faces.  
- 7 Emotion classes available.
